Safe Space provides a quick, discreet way for a player to signal that they need the game to pause. With one button press, a private alert appears for the GM only, who can then choose to pause the session or message the table. It’s designed to minimise disruption, protect the player’s privacy, and help ensure your game remains a supportive and respectful space.

Note: No additional modules required.
